### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17 years old developer, currently based near PoznaÅ„, Poland. Since late 2019 I'm helping maintain [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch), a lightweight library, which brings Fetch API to Node.js. I also maintain a collection of my own open source projects. 

When it comes to offline activities, I hugely enjoy travelling, riding a bike and listening to music.
